## **Finding an order** 🔎 

The orders are organized by date, from newest to oldest. 

Use the filters at the top of the table to narrow down your search and click on the “Search” button.

## **Exporting an order** 

You can export a list of your orders. To do that,

* Click on the cog symbol at the top right corner of the Orders section
* Choose “Export” 

 Please note that you cannot import orders.

## **Viewing an order’s details**

You can preview an order’s details by clicking on the down arrow, next to the order’s ID. This will display:

* The carrier
* The invoice details
* The products in the cart
* The total amount ****

To see more, click on the “Open details” button. This will redirect you to the order details page. 

You can also access an order directly by clicking on its line on the table, or on the magnifying glass in the “Actions” column.

## **Opening several orders in new tabs**

Save time, by opening several orders in new tabs:

* Select the orders you want to open in the list
* Open the “Bulk actions” drop-down list
* Select  “Open in new tabs”

Do not forget to allow the opening of multiple tabs in your navigator settings. 

## **Open the customer page in a new tab**

To open the customer page in a new tab, make a right-click on their name, and click on “Open in a new tab”.

## **Changing the order status**

On the “Status” column of the table, click on the order’s status and select the new status from the list. 

Changing the status from the order listing can also be very useful if you want to update the status of several orders. To do that, 

* Select the orders for which you want to update the status
* Open the “Bulk actions” drop-down list
* Select “Change order status

{% hint style="info" %}
You may have noticed a color change of the order status: you have a good eye! We indeed changed the color for better readability when releasing the 1.7.7 version of PrestaShop.
{% endhint %}

## **Download the invoice and delivery slip**

Once an invoice or a delivery slip is generated into the order, it is possible to download it in the action column.

## **Deleting an order**

{% hint style="warning" %}
You cannot delete an order. Implementing a “Delete” button would make PrestaShop illegal in Europe, as it is illegal to remove payment, ordering, or invoice information from a business.
{% endhint %}

If you want to cancel an order, change the order status to “Canceled”.
