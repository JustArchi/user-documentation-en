# Creating returns and refunds

## **Proceeding to a standard refund**

➡ It is possible to proceed to refunds when the order is paid, or when at least one payment is linked to the order. 

➡Standard refunds are accessible only when merchandise returns are enabled on the Customer service &gt; Merchandise returns page. 

➡Once the order is shipped, you cannot proceed to a standard refund anymore.

**Follow the steps:**

* Click on the “Standard refund” button

_A new column appears in the Products table, entitled “Standard refund”._

* Set the amount and quantity for each of the products you want to refund
* Choose one of the refund options See “[Choosing a refund option](creating-returns-and-refunds.md#choosing-a-refund-option)” below for more details.
* Click on the “Standard refund” button to validate

## **Proceeding to a partial refund** 

You should proceed to a partial refund if you only want to refund part of the order, either because the customer returned one of the ordered products, or simply as a sign of goodwill for a damaged product that the customer chose to keep anyway.

➡Partial refunds are only available when the order is paid, or when at least one payment is linked to the order. 

➡A partial refund is also possible after the order has left the warehouse. 

**Follow the steps:**

* Click on the “Partial refund” button

_A new column appears in the Products table, entitled “Partial refund”._

* Set the amount and quantity for each of the products you want to refund
* Choose one of the refund options See “[Choosing a refund option](creating-returns-and-refunds.md#choosing-a-refund-option)” below for more details.
* Click on the “Partial refund” button to validate 

## **Registering a product return**

➡ Registering a product return is possible only once the order is shipped and if requested by the customer. 

➡Merchandise returns should also be enabled on the Customer service &gt; Merchandise returns page.

Merchandise return requests from the customer are available in the Merchandise returns tab.

**Follow the steps:**

Make sure that you have received the returned products. If everything is ok, you can mark it as “returned” directly from the order page:

* Click on the “Return products” button

_A new column appears in the Products table, entitled “Return products”._

* Select the products and quantity returned
* Choose one of the refund options See “[Choosing a refund option](creating-returns-and-refunds.md#choosing-a-refund-option)” below for more details
* Click on the “Return products” button to validate ****

## **‌Choosing a refund option**

When you set a product as returned or to be refunded, four options are available, depending on the order status: 

### **Re-stock products** 

When registering a product return, you may choose to re-stock the products in question.

If you select this option, PrestaShop will consider that the returned product is available for sale again, and will therefore increase the stock for this product.

You should make sure not to check the “Re-stock products” box if the returned product has a manufacturing defect or is broken.
{% endhint %}

### **Generate a credit slip** 

When proceeding to a refund, you may choose to generate a credit slip. 

➡ A credit slip is an acknowledgment from the store that the merchandise refund has been issued. This will be used for accounting purposes.

Depending on your refund policy, you might pay the customer back or generate a voucher for their next purchase.

### **Generate a voucher**

When proceeding to a refund, you may choose to generate a voucher.

➡A voucher takes the form of a discount code that the customer can enter during the checkout process.   
  
In PrestaShop, vouchers are part of a special kind of discount feature: "cart rules". They can be created and edited from the Discounts &gt; Cart rules page. You can also edit customers' existing vouchers directly from the Customer page, in the vouchers section.

### **Repay shipping costs**

You can choose to repay the shipping costs of the returned products. It is always an appreciated gesture!
