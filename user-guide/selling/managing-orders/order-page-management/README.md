# Order page management

## Understanding the order page organization

Divided into **6 sections**, the page provides you all the details about an order. 

â¬† At the **top of the page** is a **quick summary** of the order containing the: 

* order reference 
* customerâ€™s name
* total price 
* date and hour of validation

â†– In the **top left-hand corner**, the **Customer section** gives you information about the customer and the private note, if any. You can even access the customer's personal file to see more details.

ðŸ”½ Just under the Products section, there is an **administrative section** that contains **four tabs** that give you access to the: 

* status and status history of the order
* documents related to the order \(e.g. invoice, delivery slip, etc.\)
* shipping information 
* merchandise returns
