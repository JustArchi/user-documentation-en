## Understanding the order page organization

Divided into **6 sections**, the page provides you all the details about an order. 

:arrow_up: At the **top of the page** is a **quick summary** of the order containing the: 

* order reference 
* customerâ€™s name
* total price 
* date and hour of validation

:arrow_upper_left: In the **top left-hand corner**, the **Customer section** gives you information about the customer and the private note, if any. You can even access the customer's personal file to see more details.
