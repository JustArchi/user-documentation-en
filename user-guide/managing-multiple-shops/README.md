# Managing multiple stores

The multistore feature allows you to manage several front offices from a single back office. 

This feature is especially useful if you are in one of the following cases:

* **You want to set a different domain name for each of your stores.** 
* **You want to have a B2B and a B2C version of your store.** 
* **You want your stores to have different branding and layouts.** 
* **You want to sell the same products at a different price in your different stores.**
